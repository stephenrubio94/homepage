			<h2>About</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
				Hi!  I'm Stephen Rubio, and I'm a video game technical designer and gameplay programmer.  <br />
				<br />
				I currently live in the LA area, and am looking to get into AAA game dev as a designer or developer.  I make small games using the Unreal, Unity, and Creation engines, which you can find in the <a href="portfolio.html" target="_blank">portfolio</a> section of my site. My favorites are <i>Derelict 54</i>, a first-person adventure game inspried by immersive sims and survival games, and <i>Eventide</i>, a first-person platformer that tries to capture to mechanical complexity and presense of the movement system of Mirror's Edge and its contemporaries. <br/>

				<br />
				In college, I studied Computer Science Education at Fordham University, where, due to a lack of formal game studies classes, I took a collection of classes from multiple disciplines to better understand many of the ideas that underpin games.  My senior thesis, <i>Critical Rebellion, Critical Revolution</i>, was a dive into the underlying cultural forces behind the GamerGate incident in August 2014.<br />
				<br />

				I also write a blog on game design and narrative structure, <a href="https://blog.stephenrubio.com/" target="_blank">So We Became Artists</a>.  Some of my favorites pieces are <a href="https://blog.stephenrubio.com/2016/08/09/by-will-and-wits-alone-near-death-survival-themed-games/" target="_blank"> By Will and Wits Alone</a>, a piece on survival themed games and genre, <a href="https://blog.stephenrubio.com/2016/07/03/massive-effect-get-it/" target="_blank"> Massive Effect</a>, a three-part series on the Mass Effect games, and <a href="https://blog.stephenrubio.com/2017/07/22/the-mirrors-edge-legacy/" target="_blank">The Mirror's Edge Legacy</a>, a deep dive into the Mirror's Edge games and their influence on first-person movement systems.<br />

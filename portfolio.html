					<div class="projectname"> Geolocation RPG – Unity Engine, iOS/Android - Big Red Button</div>
					<p> Worked on a medium-sized team to create a geolocation-based core RPG based on a major IP.  My primary projects included implementing an audio system based on Wwise, creating modular systems for player abilities to allow easy expansion, and working with designers and other programmers to implement and balance low-level combat mechanics.

					<div class="projectname">Puzzle/Horror Game [Canceled] – Unreal Engine - PC/Console - Big Red Button</div>
					<p> I worked closely with a team of artists and designers to create an action-adventure puzzle game based on a major IP.  On the project, I overhauled the animation system to better support synced animations, converted the project from Unreal Blueprints to C++, and designed the enemy AI system.

					<div class="projectname">Seven Miracles - Panogramma</div>
					<p>I worked as the lead programmer on Seven Miracles 6DOF, the first feature-length VR film, in the Unity engine.  I helped created full 3D scenes, and added support for multiple VR headsets.  See more <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/newsroom/2018-08-23/" target="_blank">here</a>.

					<p>At Experius VR, I worked on a VR project using photogrammetry assets from King Tut's Tomb.  The project is built in Unreal Engine 4 using blueprints and C++.  I worked with artists and designers to build gameplay features and improve them based on feedback from designers and our publisher.

					<div class="projectname">Derelict 54 & VR - Unreal Engine - PC - Personal</div>
					<p>Derelict 54 is a first-person and VR adventure game I made in the Unreal Engine.  It takes my ideas from Terminal 2, and translates them into full 3D, letting the player explore and try to survive a broken down space station.  It also includes a VR port/remake for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift (360-degree tracking and room scale required).

					<div class="projectname">Eventide - Unreal Engine - PC - Personal</div>
						<p>Eventide is a first-person, parkour-focused platformer made in the Unreal Engine.  Inspired by <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/17410/Mirrors_Edge/" target="_blank">Mirror's Edge</a>'s Pure Time Trials DLC, and indie title <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/406150/Refunct/" target="_blank">Refunct</a>, this game is a speed challenge level that test the player on the game's low-level mechanics.  I built the movement system from the ground up using a third-person animation blueprint to add a sense of presence and weight to the player's movements.

					<div class="projectname">DM-LaserTag - Unreal Engine - PC - Personal</div>
					<p>DM-LaserTag is a custom map I created for the new Unreal Tournament.  In it, I tried to capture the style of all the low-budget laser tag arenas I went to as a kid.  It's packed with glowing surfaces, weird, misplaced cover, and entirely too much neon.

					</br><br><a href="https://blog.stephenrubio.com/2018/06/26/dm-lasertag-devlog/">Devlog</a>
					<br>How to Play The Map (This is needlessly complicated until Epic figures out a better way of sharing user maps) <br />
					Requires Unreal Tournament from the Epic Games Launcher
					<br>-Download the map from <a href="content/DM-LaserTag1-WindowsNoEditor.pak">here</a> (Compiled May 28, 2017)
					<br>-Copy it to [Unreal Tournament Install Directory]\UnrealTournament\Content\Paks
					<br>-Open Unreal Tournament
					<br>-Click "Play", "Start LAN Match", "Custom"
					<br>-Under the Maps dropdown, select DM-LaserTag1

					<div class="projectname">Terminal 2 - HTML - PC - Personal</div>
					<p>Terminal 2 was my first attempt at capturing a type of game genre that I noticed emerging in first-person adventure games I loved.  Soma, Near Death and Alien Isolation all involved trying to fix up a decaying, human-created station, while completing objectives and avoiding hazards.  I found these games incredibly engaging, not for their horror elements and puzzles, but instead for the rhythms of play that they created, with players moving from area to area, fixing the power, looking for new objectives, and trying to stay alive.  I loved this genre enough that I wrote <a href="https://blog.stephenrubio.com/2016/08/09/by-will-and-wits-alone-near-death-survival-themed-games/">an entire blog post</a> about how fascinating the ideas are.
					<br><br>
					Terminal 2 focused on what I think is an underexplored element of those games, namely, the broken computer terminals scattered throughout the environment that the player would struggle with.  I tried to keep it localized to a single, diegetic screen, pretending to be the fictional computer terminal the player was interacting with.  The puzzles in the game aren't complex or mind-bending, and are mostly about thoroughly searching all available areas and following written directions, which is exactly what made the games that inspired it so appealing.

					<br><br>I wrote this entirely using HTML and JavaScript, instead of something more powerful like Twine, but I tried to get as much substance out of those tools as I could to get across the feeling of games with much larger budgets and scopes. </br>

          <b>DM-LaserTag</b></br>
          </br>
          DM-LaserTag was my first map for Unreal Tournament, where I tried to capture the style of all the low-budget laser tag arenas I went to as a kid.  It’s packed with glowing surfaces, weird, misplaced cover, and entirely too much neon.  
          Unreal Tournament is one of the few games still carrying the arena shooter torch, so it was a perfect fit for this idea.  This was my first time trying to create a complete, 3D shooter, instead of a tech demo, so I got to practice some of my favorite design ethos.  The core idea that I wanted to expand on for that is to create a map that is easily readable and quickly understandable, dishing out its complexity slowly over time instead of all at once.  The map is structured around a large, rectangular room with a hexagonal pit in the center that leads to the second floor, making it easy for the player to understand the basic layout and figure out where they are quickly, which is necessary for a game at UT’s speed.  Adding teleporters to the mix further necessitates the player to be able to quickly get a sense of where they are.  The bottom floor put this philosophy to the test, as I tried to recreate the mazes that many laser tag arenas contain, while sticking to this simple philosophy, so I split the map into four sections, and color-coded all the assets in each area accordingly.  This means that, even when the player is jumping across the map at crazy speeds, they can quickly see the dominant color in a scene and figure out where they are.  With that navigation established, I could proceed to add more complexity and discoveries for the player to find.  Hidden secrets are one of my favorite parts of older shooters like Doom and Quake, and I’ve scattered a few throughout my map to keep it from feeling too samey, and to keep the player constantly wondering at what’s there.</br>

          How to Play The Map (Warning: This is needlessly complicated until Epic figures out a better way of sharing user maps) <br />
          Requires Unreal Tournament from the Epic Games Launcher
          <ol>
            <li>Download the map from <a href="content/DM-LaserTag1-WindowsNoEditor.pak">here</a> (Compiled May 28, 2017)</li>
            <li>Copy it to [Unreal Tournament Install Directory]\UnrealTournament\Content\Paks</li>
            <li>Open Unreal Tournament</li>
            <li>Click “Play”, “Start LAN Match”, “Custom”</li>
            <li>Under the Maps dropdown, select DM-LaserTag1</li>

          <b>Terminal 2</b></br>
          </br>
          Terminal 2 was my first attempt at capturing a type of game genre that I noticed emerging in first-person adventure games I loved.  Soma, Near Death and Alien Isolation all involved trying to fix up a decaying, human-created station, while completing objectives and avoiding hazards.  I found these games less engaging for their horror elements or puzzles, but instead for the rhythms of play that they created, with players moving from area to area, fixing the power, looking for new objectives, and trying to stay alive.  Terminal 2 focused on what I think is an underexplored element of those games, namely, the computer terminals connection to broken systems that the player would have to struggle with.  I tried to keep it localized to a single, diegetic screen, pretending to be the fictional computer terminal the player was interacting with.  The puzzles in the game aren’t complex or mind-bending, and are mostly about thoroughly searching all available areas and following written directions, which is exactly what made the games that inspired it so appealing.  I wrote this entirely using HTML and JavaScript, instead of something more powerful like Twine, but I tried to get as much substance out of those tools as I could to get across the feeling of games with much larger budgets and scopes. </br>

          <b>Kroz</b></br>
          </br>
          Kroz is a Twine remake of Zork, Infocom’s famous text adventure game.  I was really interested at the time in the difference between text parser-based adventure games and more contemporary adventure games with clearly communicated inputs.  Kroz works more as an experiment than a satisfying experiment in and of itself, because it highlights how many of the puzzles that worked so well in Zork are less effective when every option the player can take has to be conveyed to them directly.  Still, the less confusing structure of a Twine game, coupled with its use of the widely-know hypertext format, made it more accessible than Zork, which has a reputation for impenetrability.  Despite having much more advanced tools than Infocom’s original team, I left Zork feeling jealous of the format that they were able to use, with a text parser allowing for much more creative, if difficult to discover, solutions to problems.</br>
